# Overview & motivation

Patients with schizophrenia (SC) show differences in oscillations compared to healthy controls (HC) in EEG signal. These differences are presented during resting state and during tasks. In this project we are focussed on differences during resting state. The underlying method to use for the purpose of the project will be a frequency-band-analysis. Delta and theta oscillations for example are increased during rest in schizophrenia compared to controls (Bates et al., 2009). Patients with schizophrenia also show abnormalities in gamma oscillations, but the results vary across different stimulations and tasks (Light et al., 2006; Moran et al., 2011). Additionally, during rest alpha and beta seem to show a reduced activation (Uhlhaas & Singer, 2010; Moran et al., 2011). These differences could be useful neurophysiological markers which might provide information about what are differences in neural processings between people with schizophrenia and healthy ones. After all, it should be possible to elaborate some special features of differences in various frequency-bands between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

# Aim of the study
 * finding differences in the different frequency bands between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls

# What is the motivation to conduct the project?
 * we want to learn how to preprocess and analyse EEG data because we never did this before
 * schizophrenia is a very interesting disease to look after differences to healthy persons
 * the diagnostic of schizophrenia is not very easy, so we want to display differences in frequency bands as possible neurophysiological markers

# What is the proposed approach to conduct the project?
 * Literature search
 * Work with open science programs like Github, jupyter notebook and programming in python
 * Data analysis
 * Statistics
 * Designing and writing a poster
 * Scientific talk
