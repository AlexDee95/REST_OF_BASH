# week 3 (17.05. -23.05.)
* writing again an email to Ilvana -> Ilvana told me, that she is in contact with the IT to solve the downloading problem
* writing an e-mail to Daniel Hermens -> „BMRI Electroencephalography (EEG) clinical research data“ from the University of Sydney -> still waiting for an answer
* trying out commands on docker and conda

# week 4 (24.05. -30.05.)
* trying out commands on jupyter but actually it only works on binder 

# week 5 (31.05. -06.06.)
* talk with Alex about the answer from Elzbieta Olejarczyk
* have a look on the paper and the eeg data from the study: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188629

* now my jupyter notebook works with my PC and my command system

* programmed a calculator with Python code in Alex' jupyter notebook in cooperation with Alex
* after that I programmed my own calculator

# week 6 (07.06. -13.06.)
* downloaded the EEG data files from https://repod.icm.edu.pl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18150/repod.0107441
* updated data*.md
