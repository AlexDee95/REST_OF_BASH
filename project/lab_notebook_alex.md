### - at the moment, three possible sources are:
#### - https://repod.icm.edu.pl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18150/repod.0107441
#### - http://brain.bio.msu.ru/eeg_schizophrenia.htm
#### - https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Monash_Study/12752399?file=24131678
### - probably we found the paper to the last of these three data sets:
