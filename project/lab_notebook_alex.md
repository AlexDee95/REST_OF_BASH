# week 1 (10.5. - 17.5.)

## GitHub and GitKraken:

### - created github repository "LASERPIN"
### - updated README.md file
### - updated project.md
### - updated data*.md
### - updated labnotebook
### - created a timeline on GitKraken

## Search for raw EEG data:

### - it has turned out to be quite difficult to find suitable raw EEG data of schizophrenia patients for our purposes
### - at the moment, three possible sources are:
#### - https://repod.icm.edu.pl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18150/repod.0107441
#### - http://brain.bio.msu.ru/eeg_schizophrenia.htm
#### - https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Monash_Study/12752399?file=24131678
### - probably we found the paper to the last of these three data sets:
#### - https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/aberrant-connectivity-in-auditory-precision-encoding-in-schizophr

# week 2 (17.5. - 24.5.)

## Docker:

### - try to fix Docker and to get familiar with on my system

## Literature and data:

### - try to find well suiting articles about our topic and to contact the responsible researchers to get raw data from them

# week 3 (24.5. - 31.5.)

## Jupyter Notebook:

### - got familiar with Jupyter Notebook
### - checked how to open standard .ipynb files in my JN
### - checked how to create a new file with Python Code

# week 4 (31.5. - 7.6.)

## New messages regarding data:

### - the first of June I received a message from Elzbieta Olejarczyk from Poland
### - she said that their data is in .edf format which might be useful for us
### - this data set includes eeg signals from 14 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls
### - this is the article which probably belongs to this eeg measurement:
#### - https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188629

## Practice with Jupyter Notebook and Python:

### - programmed a calculator with Python code in my jupyter notebook in cooperation with Anna
### - uploaded it here in our repo under the file name Calc.ipynb

# week 5 (7.6. - 14.6.)
