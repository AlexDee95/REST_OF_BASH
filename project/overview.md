# Overview & motivation

Patients with schizophrenia (SC) show differences in oscillations compared to healthy controls (HC) in EEG signal. These differences are presented during resting state and during tasks. In this project we are focussed on differences during resting state. The underlying method to use for the purpose of the project will be a frequency-band-analysis. Delta and theta oscillations for example are increased during rest in schizophrenia compared to controls (Bates et al., 2009). Patients with schizophrenia also show abnormalities in gamma oscillations, but the results vary across different stimulations and tasks (Light et al., 2006; Moran et al., 2011). During rest gamma shows a reduced activation just like beta and alpha (Uhlhaas & Singer, 2010; Moran et al., 2011). These differences could be useful neurophysiological markers which might provide information about what are differences in neural processings between people with schizophrenia and healthy ones. After all, we hope to be able to elaborate some special features of differences in various frequency-bands between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.
