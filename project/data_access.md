# Data access

  Data probably can be accessed through one of the following links:

    - https://repod.icm.edu.pl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18150/repod.0107441

    - http://brain.bio.msu.ru/eeg_schizophrenia.htm

    - https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Monash_Study/12752399?file=24131678

  Which of these is available as raw data we still have to find out. Depending on that we'll work with one or another data set. 

* Raw data

    - t. b. c.

* Data derivatives 
    - t. b. c.
