# Welcome!

Hallo and welcome to our project: REST_OF_BASH!
This repository contains the jupyter book for the project REST_OF_BASH conducted within "Methodological Working in the Neurosciences" (2021).

## What's all this now?

REST_OF_BASH stands for "Differences in Resting-State Oscillations and Frequency Bands in Schizophrenia Patients and Healthy Controls". As part of the module "Methodological work in the neurosciences" in our Masters Schedule, we studied a typical workflow of organization and analysis of EEG data. In this project we assumed significant differences in oscialltions and frequency bands between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. On this website we present our progress, codes and results of this project.

The project includes the following parts:

* [Overview & motivation]()

* [Project outline & management plan]()

* [Dataset & management plan]()

* [Pre-registration]()

* [Open lab notebook]()  
      
* [Data analyses]()
   
* [Results & outcomes]()

* [Poster & manuscript]()

* [Data access]()

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive experience.
