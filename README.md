## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains the jupyter book for the project *REST_OF_BASH* conducted within **"Methodological Working in the Neurosciences" (2021)**.

Patients with schizophrenia show abnormalities in language processes compared to healthy controls in EEG signal. The method we want to use for the purpose of our project will be probably ERP after we were (hopefully) able to preprocess some raw EEG data from schizophrenia patients. With verbal hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder they have to fight in their daily lifes (Hirano et al., 2019). The P300 and the N400 amplitudes (Laurent et al., 2010) could be specific points of interest in the time course analysis of the signal. These could be useful neurophysiological markers which might provide information about what are differences in language processing between people with schizophrenia and healthy ones. Additionally, we could try to analyse specific data points at the skull which are probably related to language processing and compare the signal of those between schizophrenia patients and the controls. After all, we will hopefully be able to elaborate some special features of language processing of people with schizophrenia also with regard to the specific problem of formal thought disorder.

  * What is a project's zenodo badge?
  * How could I use the "class" command in Python to programm a calculator?
